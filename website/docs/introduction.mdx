CodeshiftCommunity is a community-owned global registry and documentation hub for codemods.
This project provides library users & maintainers with facilities to help [write](authoring), [test](testing), [publish](contribution) and [consume](consuming) codemods in a structured and familiar way.

## Why?

Keeping JavaScript dependencies up-to-date is an important part of maintaining a healthy codebase. Outdated dependencies can introduce security vulnerabilities, cause compatibility issues, and make it difficult to use the latest features and improvements.

One way to keep your dependencies up-to-date is by using codemods. A codemod is a tool that can automatically refactor code, which can be particularly useful when making large-scale changes to a codebase.

For example, let's say you want to update the **`lodash`** library in your codebase from version 4 to version 5. This would require updating all of the import statements, function calls, and other references to **`lodash`** in your code. Instead of manually updating each instance, you can use a codemod to do the work for you.

To use a codemod for this task, you would provide it with the old and new code for **`lodash`**, as well as the files or directories that you want to update. The codemod would then scan your code and make the necessary changes. This can save you a significant amount of time and effort.

Additionally, using a codemod for this task can help ensure that your code stays consistent and up-to-date. By automatically updating all of the references to **`lodash`**, you can avoid any potential issues that may arise from using a mix of old and new code.

Of course, it is important to carefully review the changes made by a codemod to avoid any potential errors. However, in general, codemods can be a powerful tool for keeping your JavaScript dependencies up-to-date. They can save time, ensure consistency, and help keep your codebase healthy.

## Objectives

Our main aim is to create a community centered around codemods in order to promote the use of codemods as a standard development practice across the JavaScript ecosystem.

We believe that providing the appropriate support, documentation, and tools can help us achieve this goal.

To accomplish this, CodeshiftCommunity aims to address three key challenges:

1. Fragmentation in how codemods are written and distributed within the ecosystem
1. Difficulty adopting and upgrading packages
1. Lack of documentation and understanding about codemods.

### Fragmentation in the ecosystem

Popular libraries in the ecosystem such as [React](https://github.com/reactjs/react-codemod), [material-ui](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/packages/material-ui-codemod) and [next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/codemods), all provide their own take on codemods, CLI and distribution services.
These services are varied from one another and generally quite hidden from the average user.
Providing this as an additional service to aid in upgrading their libraries is a great thing, but comes with significant overhead to those projects.

### Package adoption & upgrade pain

When publishing packages via semver, it is too easy to push the upgrade pain onto users.
Users will likely then have to go digging in either your changelog or (worst case) your code to find out how to safely migrate to the latest and greatest.
Often the solution is just to avoid upgrading entirely or migrate to a new library.

### Lack of documentation & familiarity

Writing codemods often feels like tribal knowledge, there might be only a handfull of people in your company that have written one or know how to write one. This needs to change!

## How do we solve these problems?

### A standardized CLI

Codeshift works by publishing every codemod to NPM as its own package or piggybacking off a pre-existing NPM package. We provide a [standardized CLI tool](cli) that can download and run the most up to date codemods from anywhere.
With the hidden benefit of being able to publish with dependencies, currently something that is not possible with most JSCodeshift CLI implementations.

Using NPM drastically lowers the adoption bar, since all one would need to do is publish an existing package with a `codemod.config.js` and you're good to go. See [Authoring with existing packages](http://localhost:3000/docs/authoring#2-add-codeshift-to-an-existing-package)

### A centralized registry

[DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) is a great example of how consolidating type definitions under the one roof builds familiarity and consistency for the entire typescript user base.

By consolidating codemods in the same way, the ecosystem can benefit from:

1. A single place to find, use and publish codemods
2. Community support & bug fixes
3. Countless examples

Ultimately, with the wider JS community collaborating to produce high quality versioned codemods, our goal is to achieve solid coverage over common js dependencies (ie react, jest, chalk, etc), in a similar way to how quality type definitions are created and shared within the DefinitelyTyped community.

CodeshiftCommunity provides a similar registry that hosts and automatically publishes codemods for you under the [/community directory](https://github.com/CodeshiftCommunity/CodeshiftCommunity/tree/main/community).
The community directory organizes codemods by package name and version. They are then published to npm as modules that can be retrospectively patched or improved.
This ensures that users running codemods are always getting the latest and greatest version of your codemod.

### Rich documentation

CodeshiftCommunity is a documentation hub first, by providing guides, recipes and reference material we aim demystify codemods, which are often seen as "arcane knowledge".

With the right documentation and guidance in place, it will be significantly easier to normalize codemods and reduce their learning curve.
We want to remove the stigma that "codemods are hard" or "they take a long time to write" and get everyone into the healthy practice of writing them.
Meaning that more people can contribute to writing codemods and ultimately improve the javascript ecosystem's adoption problem.
