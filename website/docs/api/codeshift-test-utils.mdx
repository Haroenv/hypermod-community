CodeshiftCommunity provides a set of test utilities to help unit test codemods.

## Installation

`@codeshift/test-utils` is pre-bundled with every codemod that is published to [the public registry](https://github.com/CodeshiftCommunity/CodeshiftCommunity/tree/main/community),
so there's no need to install it manually.

However, it is also available for use outside of this project and compatible with jscodeshift.

`npm install --save-dev @codeshift/test-utils` or `yarn add -D @codeshift/test-utils`

## API

### `applyTransform`

`applyTransform(transform, input, options = { parser: 'babel' })`

Runs a transform against the provided code and returns the resulting file.

We provide this method as opposed to [jscodeshift's test utils](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift#unit-testing) to maintain jest's skip/only and snapshot features

**Returns**

`Promise<string>`: Resulting file after transform has been applied

**Example**

```jsx
import * as transformer from '../transform';
import { applyTransform } from '@codeshift/test-utils';

it('should wrap avatar in a tooltip if name is defined', async () => {
  const result = await applyTransform(
    transformer,
    `
      import Avatar from 'avatar';

      const App = () => {
        return <Avatar name="foo" />;
      }
    `,
    { parser: 'tsx' },
  );

  expect(result).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    "import Tooltip from 'tooltip';
    import Avatar from 'avatar';

    const App = () => {
      return <Tooltip content=\\"foo\\"><Avatar name=\\"foo\\" /></Tooltip>;
    }"
  `);
});
```
