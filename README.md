## CLI 

Downloading and running codemods as well as initialising and maintaining codemod packages can all be done via the Codeshift CLI (`@codeshift/cli`).

[Please see the docs for more information and examples](https://www.codeshiftcommunity.com/docs/cli)

We recommend running the CLI with $ npx to ensure you always have the latest version.

`$ npx @codeshift/cli --packages mylib@1.0.0 /project/src`

But it can also be installed globally:

`$ npm install -g @codeshift/cli or yarn global add @codeshift/cli`

and run with:

`$ codeshift or $ codeshift-cli`
